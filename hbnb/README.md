### PROJECT DESCRIPTION &ensp; ‚úèÔ∏è
<hr>
This is part 3 of the HBnB project and the second implemention phase of the HBnB application based on the codebase in part 2.
This phase focuses on extending the backend of the application by adding user authentication, authorization and integration of the database using SQLAlchemy and MySQL.

### PART 2 OBJECTIVES &ensp; ‚úÖ
<hr>

* Modify user registration by including the password field and implement password hashing using bcrypt.
* Implement JWT-based user authentication using Flask-JWT-Extended to enable secure login through token generation.
* Secure certain endpoints via JWT token generation to only allow authenticated users to perform certain actions.
* Add administrative priviledges to specific API endpoints to allow administrators to perform certain actions without being restricted by ownership of Places and Reviews.
* Replace the in-memory repository with SQLAlchemy to help integrate persistent storage.
* Map system entities (User, Amenity, Place, Review) to the MySQL database using SQLAlchemy.
* Map the relationships between system entities, including "one-to-many" relationships (User and Places, Place and Reviews and User and Reviews) the "many-to-many" relationship (Place and Amenities and Amenities and Places).

### HOW TO INSTALL IT &ensp; üîß
<hr>

The requirements needed for part 3 are:
* flask
* flaskrestx
* flask-bcrypt
* flask-jwt-extended
* sqlalchemy
* flask-sqlalchemy

To install the requirements, download the repository, navigate to the part3/hbnb folder and use the following command to install:
<br>

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### HOW TO RUN IT &ensp; üñ•Ô∏è
<hr>
Once requirments are installed, ensure the MySQL server is running and initialise the database. This can be done in flask shell.
Run the run.py file to launch the application and start up the Flask development server.
This will allow the user to interact with the application locally.
<br>

```
flask shell
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
```

```
python3 run.py
```

### API ENDPOINTS &ensp; ‚öôÔ∏è

Part 3 includes the same API endpoints from part 2 plus ($${\color{lightgreen}+}$$) admin.py, auth.py and protected.py 
<br>

$${\color{lightgreen}+}$$__Auth__:
<br>
* Initiate a login process and generate token POST /api/v1/auth/login/

$${\color{lightgreen}+}$$ __Protected__:
* Allows user to make authenticated requests to protected endpoints GET /api/v1/protected

$${\color{lightgreen}+}$$ __Admin__:
<br>
The following endpoints are restricted to administrators only.
Administrators can delete any place or review.
* Create a new user POST /api/v1/admin/users/
* Modify a user's details, including email and password PUT /api/v1/admin/users/<user_id>
